# connect_four
connect four game!

Implements a modified alphabeta minimax AI strategy for connect four in python.

The cf_revised module contains the Board class, which instantiates a connectfour board that will print to the console using the ppprint module

The stratsRevised module contains the minimax, alphabeta and utility functions, as well as the functions for playing a game in terminal

Run the stratsRevised script to actually play a game against the computer in terminal (see bottom of the file to see what kind of game and what kind of AI will be implemented.)
